## What is VoodooI2C?

VoodooI2C is a project consisting of macOS kernel extensions that add support for I2C bus devices. The project is split into two main components: the **core** extension and various other **satellite** extensions.

### The Core

The core is the `VoodooI2C.kext` kernel extension. This kext is intended to be installed by anyone whose computer requires some form of I2C support. It consists of I2C controller drivers and is responsible for publishing device nubs to the IOService plane.

### The Satellites

The satellites are a collection of various kernel extensions that implement support for a specific type of I2C device. An example of a satellite kext is `VoodooI2CHID.kext` which adds support for I2C-HID devices. Usually a user will install one satellite kext per class of I2C device.

## Current Status

The following Intel I2C controllers are fully supported:

1. `INT33C2` and `INT33C3` - Haswell era
2. `INT3432` and `INT3433` - Broadwell era
3. `pci8086,9d60`, `pci8086,9d61`, `pci8086,9d62` and `pci8086,9d63` - Skylake era
4. `pci8086,a160` and `pci8086,a161` - Kaby Lake era
5. `pci8086,9de8` and `pci8086,9de9` - Cannon Lake/Whiskey Lake era
6. `pci8086,a368`, `pci8086,a369`, `pci8086,a36a` and `pci8086,a36b` - Coffee Lake era
7. `pci8086,2e8` and `pci8086,2e9` - Comet Lake era

The following device classes are fully supported:

1. I2C-HID devices
2. ELAN devices
3. FTE devices

Note that there is sometimes an overlap between device classes. For example, some ELAN devices may also be I2C-HID devices.
